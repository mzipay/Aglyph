Aglyph is a Dependency Injection framework for Python 2.5+, supporting
type 2 (setter) and type 3 (constructor) injection.

Aglyph runs on CPython (http://www.python.org/) 2.5 - 3.3, and on recent
versions of the PyPy (http://pypy.org/>),
Jython (http://www.jython.org/), IronPython (http://ironpython.net/),
and Stackless Python (http://www.stackless.com/) variants.

Aglyph can assemble "prototype" components (a new instance is created
every time), "singleton" components (the same instance is returned every
time), and "borg" components (a new instance is created every time, but
all instances of the same class share the same internal state).

Aglyph can be configured using a declarative XML syntax, or
programmatically in pure Python.

Aglyph is not a "full stack;" only dependency injection support is
provided.

For the definitive introduction to the Dependency Injection pattern,
please read Martin Fowler's article "Inversion of Control Containers and
the Dependency Injection pattern"
(http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html).

For a brief overview of Dependency Injection in Python (including a
discussion of alternatives), please read Alex Martelli's article "Python
Dependency Injection" (http://www.aleax.it/yt_pydi.pdf).

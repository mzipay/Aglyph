<!--
Note that although the document encoding states "windows-1252", this
physical file is actually UTF-8-encoded.

The test method will read the file as UTF-8, producing Unicode text, and
then encode to windows-1252. The windows-1252 bytes will then be passed
to ET.XML along with the CLRXMLParser.

This approach is taken to remain consistent w/r/t the test XML files
that are used for aglyph.context.XMLContext.

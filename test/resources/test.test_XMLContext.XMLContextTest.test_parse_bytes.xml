<!--
Note that although the document encoding states "windows-1252", this
physical file is actually UTF-8-encoded.

The test method will read the file as UTF-8, producing Unicode text, and
then encode to windows-1252. The windows-1252 bytes will then be
stored in a byte buffer which will serve as the stream passed to
XMLContext.

This approach is necessary to ensure that the test suite runs
consistently across platforms and Python implementations.
(IronPython on Windows is a particular pain point in this regard.)
